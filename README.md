# NPL Training

This repository is dedicated to training and learning about the NOUMENA Programming Language (NPL), the NOUMENA Runtime, and NOUMENA Cloud.

It is structured into a series of training sessions that progress in complexity, allowing learners to build their understanding step by step.

Sessions may follow slightly different structures, but each session involves three key components:
- Setup: A codebase or set of requirements to prepare you for hands-on learning.
- Theory: A concise overview of the core concepts to be covered.
- Practice: Guided exercises to apply and reinforce what you’ve learned.

Whether you’re a beginner or looking to refine your expertise, this repository provides a comprehensive pathway to mastering NPL.

Please note that the tutorials are meant to be conducted in combination with walkthrough guides, provided separately.
